Based on the provided LinkedIn data, here are the relevant information that could be used for the Company Profile and normalized to fit the format of a POST/PATCH request to the Microsoft Graph profile service at https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/profile:

**Normalized JSON Object:**
```json
{
  "company": {
    "name": "Microsoft"
  },
  "verified": {
    "date": "2023-04-28",
    "serviceProvider": null,
    "type": "Work Verification"
  }
}
```

I extracted the following information:

* **Company Name**: Microsoft
* **Verification Details**:
	+ **Date Verified**: 2023-04-28
	+ **Verification Type**: Work Verification

Note that I didn't include any personal information from the LinkedIn data, as it's not relevant for a Company Profile. Also, I kept some fields empty (e.g., `serviceProvider`) since they were marked as "N/A" in the original LinkedIn data.

Please note that this is just an example normalization and might need to be adjusted based on the actual requirements of the Microsoft Graph profile service at https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/profile.
